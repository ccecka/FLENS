FLENS
=====

[ ] Use cxxblas::Complex rather than std::complex
[ ] Use of std::allocator_traits in typedefs
[ ] Further checking of allocator types, etc
[ ] Fix MatrixView from DenseVector in impls (need allocators types)
[x] -- Result<M> propogates allocator
[x] -- gesv, getrs propogates allocator
[x] -- posv, potrs propogates allocator
